	  While some platform will work without the blobs (given that
	  the ATF source code for that platform is available), some like
	  RK35XX doesn't have ATF source code available. Thus being the
	  only choice to get a working system.

	  If your platform requires rkbin, say Y. The binaries will be
	  dropped into BINARIES_DIR.
